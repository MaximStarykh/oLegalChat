# oLegal Agent Run: Sync main to commit

**Task:** Make it main and sync here to b044adc4c896398513cc17562a0be2e4bb5c42ca github

## PLAN

1.  Create a run file for this task.
2.  Identify the git remote URL to fetch from.
3.  Stash the current uncommitted changes to prevent data loss.
4.  Fetch from the remote repository to ensure the target commit `b044adc4c896398513cc17562a0be2e4bb5c42ca` is available.
5.  Reset the `main` branch to the specified commit.
6.  The worktree will be clean, matching the specified commit. The stashed changes can be reapplied later if needed.

## ACTIONS

-   Identified git remote `origin` pointing to `https://github.com/MaximStarykh/oLegalChat.git`.
-   Stashed local changes to get a clean working directory.
-   Fetched updates from `origin`.
-   Reset `main` branch to commit `b044adc4c896398513cc17562a0be2e4bb5c42ca`.

## CHECKS

-   `git status` confirms the working directory is clean.
-   `git log -1` confirms the HEAD is at the target commit.

## DIFF

The working directory is now clean and matches the state of commit `b044adc4c896398513cc17562a0be2e4bb5c42ca`. No local changes are present. The previously stashed changes are available to be reapplied with `git stash pop` if needed.
