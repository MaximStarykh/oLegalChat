## Audit Findings

### High Priority

*   **Type Safety:** Widespread use of `as unknown as` and `any` bypasses TypeScript's safety features. This should be refactored to use proper types to prevent runtime errors.
*   **Error Handling:** Several API endpoints return a `200 OK` status code even when an error occurs (e.g., when Supabase is unavailable). This is misleading and should be corrected to return appropriate error codes (e.g., `500`).
*   **Complex Functions:** The `extractRealSources` function in `app/api/chat/route.ts` is overly complex and contains hardcoded values. It should be refactored for clarity and maintainability.

### Medium Priority

*   **Magic Strings:** Hardcoded model names like `"gemini-2.5-flash"` should be replaced with constants to improve maintainability.
*   **UI/UX:** The display of tool invocation arguments and results is not user-friendly. It should be improved to be more readable, for example, by using a collapsible tree view.
*   **Semantic HTML:** Heading tags (`h1`-`h6`) are being overridden to render as `p` tags in some components. This removes the semantic meaning of the headings and should be corrected.

### Low Priority

*   **Unused Code:** The `handleStreamError` function is marked as deprecated but is still present in the codebase. It should be removed.
*   **Dependencies:** The project is missing the `eslint-config-next` package, which is causing a warning in the linter.
