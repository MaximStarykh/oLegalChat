# Plan

- Review repository structure and key modules to understand functionality.
- Search for known security-sensitive areas (CSRF, sanitization, encryption) for potential issues.
- Run TypeScript type checking, linting, tests, and build to detect problems.
- Document findings of any bugs or issues with citations to source lines.
- Log actions and checks as per AGENTS instructions.
